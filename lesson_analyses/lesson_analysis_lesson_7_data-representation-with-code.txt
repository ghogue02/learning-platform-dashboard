Analysis for Lesson: 'data-representation-with-code' (Lesson ID: 7)

### Analysis of Student Messages

#### 1. Concepts or Topics Students are **Struggling** to Understand:
Based on the analyzed messages, students appear to struggle primarily with:
- **Polymorphism**: Although students like Shaniqua and Kenny demonstrate an understanding of polymorphism, they often need clarification on how it applies to different classes and methods. They sometimes mix up terminology or concepts when attempting to explain it back.
- **Encapsulation**: Students occasionally confuse how encapsulation restricts direct access to object properties, needing analogies to clarify the concept. 

**Example Messages**:
- "i understand what i am reading i am unclear how to relay it back in my own words."
- "it allows methods to do different things depending on the object they are acting on."

#### 2. Concepts or Topics Students Seem to **Understand Well**:
Students show a good grasp of the following concepts:
- **Basic Object Representation**: Many students can create a simple object with properties without difficulty.
- **Data Structures**: Students demonstrate understanding when asked to represent collections of objects, like lists or arrays.
- **Inheritance**: The concept of inheritance is well understood, with students explaining it correctly as subclasses inheriting properties and methods from parent classes.

**Example Messages**:
- "a class is like a blueprint for an object determining the object's attributes and methods."
- "inheritance allows you to create a child class which will inherit all the properties from the parent class/superclass."

#### 3. Examples or Quotes from Messages:
- **Struggles**:
  - "are there any other important uses for polymorphism?"
  - "mySportsCar.park(); I am ready to move forward."
  
- **Understanding**:
  - "an object is a collection of key value pairs they are used to represent complex data in a structured way."
  - "let myNewCar = new Car('Blue', 'Jeep', 'Grand Wagoneer', 0);"

#### 4. Summary of Main Areas of Struggle and Understanding:
- **Struggles**: Students primarily struggle with abstract concepts like polymorphism and encapsulation, often needing additional explanations, analogies, or examples to solidify their understanding. They also encounter difficulties when trying to articulate their understanding in their own words.
  
- **Understanding**: Students demonstrate a strong grasp of basic object representation, data structures, and inheritance. They can create and manipulate basic objects and understand how properties and methods work together in classes. 

Overall, while students are progressing well, reinforcing the more abstract concepts through practical examples and analogies could enhance their understanding and retention.
