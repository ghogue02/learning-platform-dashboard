- **Understanding ES Modules vs. CommonJS**: Some students express confusion over the differences between ES Modules and CommonJS, particularly regarding syntax and import/export mechanisms. 
  - Example: A student asked for clarification on the task CommonJS performed in Node.js and how ES Modules are better at it.
- **Setting Up the Project**: Students seem to struggle with the initial steps of setting up a Node.js project to use ES Modules, particularly the configuration of the `package.json` file.
  - Example: A student mentioned needing clarification on where to add `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.
- **Dynamic vs. Static Imports**: There appears to be confusion regarding whether ES Modules support dynamic imports as CommonJS does, leading some students to question the differences.
  - Example: A student specifically asked if ES Modules can be imported inside functions or if statements.

### 2. Concepts or Topics Students Seem to **Understand Well**:
- **Basic Syntax of Import/Export**: Many students grasp the basic syntax of ES Modules, including how to use `import` and `export`.
  - Example: A student confidently stated they understood how to export a function from a module and import it in another module.
- **Creating a `package.json` File**: Students generally understand how to initialize a Node.js project and create a `package.json` file using `npm init -y`.
  - Example: Several students confirmed they successfully created their `package.json` file.

### 3. Specific Examples or Quotes:
- **Struggles**:
  - “What particular task did CommonJS perform in Node.js and how is ES Modules better at performing that or those tasks?”
  - “Can you explain back to me the steps to setting up a Node.js project to use ES Modules?”
- **Understanding**:
  - “I have the following clarifying questions: What particular task did CommonJS perform in Node.js and how is ES Modules better at performing that or those tasks?”
  - “Yes, I'm ready for the next lesson.”

### 4. Summary of Main Areas of Struggle and Understanding:
- **Areas of Struggle**: Students are primarily struggling to understand the fundamental differences between ES Modules and CommonJS, how to properly set up a Node.js project for ES Modules, and the details surrounding dynamic vs. static imports.
- **Areas of Understanding**: Students are successfully grasping the basic import/export syntax of ES Modules and the process of creating a `package.json` file. They show readiness to move forward once foundational concepts are clarified.

### Conclusion
Overall, the lesson on "esm-modules" has highlighted a mix of understanding and confusion among students regarding the transition from CommonJS to ES Modules, particularly in practical implementation and fundamental differences.
