## Part 1: CONCISE Executive Summary - Top 3 Curriculum Improvement Priorities

### 1. **Understanding Functions and Their Return Values**
- **Description:** Students often confuse the distinction between console logging values and returning values from functions, impacting their ability to effectively utilize functions in their code.
- **Example:** A student asked, "How should it look in the console?" indicating uncertainty about return values.
- **Severity Level:** High
- **Recommendation:** Integrate more interactive exercises focusing on the return statement, contrasting it with console logging through visual aids and explicit examples that demonstrate both concepts in practice.

### 2. **Conflict Resolution in Git and GitHub**
- **Description:** Students struggle with merging changes, understanding pull requests, and handling merge conflicts, which are critical for collaborative coding.
- **Example:** A student reported difficulties with "error messages to resolve the conflict."
- **Severity Level:** High
- **Recommendation:** Provide additional video tutorials and hands-on exercises that simulate real-world scenarios involving merging and conflict resolution, along with clear, step-by-step guides on how to manage these situations.

### 3. **Markdown Syntax and Formatting**
- **Description:** Students frequently make syntax errors when formatting text in Markdown, particularly with bold, italics, and lists.
- **Example:** A student formatted "##Bold Text lesson" without the necessary space, indicating confusion about header syntax.
- **Severity Level:** Medium
- **Recommendation:** Create a dedicated interactive Markdown playground where students can practice formatting in real-time, with immediate feedback on errors and tips for correct syntax.

## Part 2: PRIORITIZED Lesson-Specific Opportunity Insights for Coaches

### Lesson: git
- **[Conflict Resolution]:** Encourage students to practice resolving merge conflicts in a controlled environment, using collaborative exercises that simulate real-world scenarios.
- **[Pull Requests Understanding]:** Provide clear examples distinguishing between pull requests and merging, perhaps through flowcharts or video demonstrations.
- **[Branching Concepts]:** Reinforce the concept of branching with visual aids and practical exercises that require students to create and manage branches.

### Lesson: intro-to-algorithms
- **[Algorithm Definition]:** Prompt students to define algorithms in their own words and relate them to everyday tasks to solidify understanding.
- **[Breaking Down Tasks]:** Facilitate group exercises where students collaboratively break down simple tasks into algorithms, enhancing peer learning.
- **[Real-World Analogies]:** Use more tangible examples to explain algorithms, such as cooking recipes, to help students visualize the steps involved.

### Lesson: json-and-persisting-data
- **[Persisting Data]:** Provide real-world case studies illustrating the importance of data persistence in applications to enhance understanding.
- **[JSON Parsing]:** Develop interactive coding challenges where students practice parsing JSON and stringifying objects with immediate feedback on their attempts.
- **[CRUD Operations]:** Reinforce CRUD operations through practical exercises that require students to apply these concepts in small projects.

### Lesson: markdown
- **[Markdown Syntax Practice]:** Direct students to an interactive Markdown editor where they can practice syntax and receive instant feedback.
- **[Creating Lists]:** Organize exercises focused specifically on creating lists, with examples and clear guidelines on formatting.
- **[Header Formatting]:** Offer visual aids and practice tasks centered around correctly formatting headers in Markdown.

### Lesson: functions
- **[Return vs. Console Logging]:** Create targeted exercises that allow students to compare return values with console outputs side-by-side.
- **[Parameters vs. Arguments]:** Use analogy-based teaching to clarify the distinction between parameters and arguments, possibly through relatable examples.
- **[Function Exercises]:** Design practice tasks that require students to write and call functions, emphasizing the output and return statements.
